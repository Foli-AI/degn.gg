# ⚙️ Recommended Export Settings

**For embedding in DEGN.gg iframe**

---

## ✅ **Recommended Settings**

### **Options Tab:**

**Progressive Web App:**
- ❌ **Enabled: OFF** (we don't need PWA features, we're embedding in iframe)

**Canvas Resize Policy:**
- ✅ **"Project"** (better for fixed-size game in iframe)
- Alternative: "Adaptive" also works, but "Project" is more predictable

**Focus Canvas On Start:**
- ✅ **ON** (so game gets focus when loaded - helps with input)

**Experimental Virtual Keyboard:**
- ❌ **OFF** (not needed for desktop/mobile web)

**Display:**
- ✅ **"Standalone"** (works fine in iframe)

**Orientation:**
- ✅ **"Any"** (works for all devices)

**Background Color:**
- ✅ **Black** (or your game's background color)

## 🎯 **Minimum Required Settings**

**For basic export, you only need:**
1. ✅ **Export Path:** Set to `../degn/degn-arcade/public/games/sol-bird/client/index.html`
2. ✅ **Canvas Resize Policy:** "Project" or "Adaptive" (both work)
3. ✅ **Focus Canvas On Start:** ON (recommended)

**Everything else can be left as default!**

## 🚀 **Ready to Export!**

**If your export path is correct, you can export now!**

The Progressive Web App setting won't break anything if it's ON, but it's not needed. You can leave it as-is or turn it off - either way works.

**Go ahead and click "Export Project..." when ready! 🎮**
